# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_in_Python_IITB-upGrad
This EDA project is a part of the course 'Data Toolkit' from Data Science and AI program from IIT Bangalore and upGrad.
The Dataset used for the project is related to the financial and banking system. 
There are three files containing data about loan applications:
1. application_data.csv (307511 rows, 122 cols)
2. previous_application.csv(1670214 rows, 37cols)
3. column_description.csv (describes all the columns in applicaiton_data.csv and previous_application.csv)
The EDA is done on jupyter notebook and an accomodating ppt is uploaded to summarize findings and recommendations out of the Exploration of the Dataset.

Github doesn't allow to upload files of size bigger than 25mb. Hence, I couldn't upload the application_data.csv (162 mb) and previous_application.csv (395 mb).
However, I have provided the columns_description table for reference of the two datasets.
